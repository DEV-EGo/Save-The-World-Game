# Save-The-World-Game
This web app was made with the use of HTML, JS, CSS, JQUERY. The user will be able to navigate and move the image of the "captain planet" with their mouse pad or keyboard. JQUERY is being used to trigger &amp; target the button events. Audio files have been added within the jumbotron that pay homage to the theme song of the original cartoon.
